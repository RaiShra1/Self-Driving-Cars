Longitudinal and Lateral Control: Implementation of Speed Controller and Steering Controller for Autonomous Car. The Speed Controller is comprised of a PID controller tuned for the given model of the Car. The Lateral or Steering Angle controller is a Stanley Controller. 
The algorithms are run on a Carla Simulator which simulates a driving environment and the waypoints i.e. x,y coordinates and velocity profile is given in a text file and our controller generates a trajectory.txt at the end as a result.
